Explanation of Features:
Driver Distraction Monitoring: Detects if the driver is distracted based on simulated random values.
Lane Change Alerts: Warns the driver if lane departure is detected.
Hydroplaning Detection: Asks the driver if they want to activate hydroplaning detection when water is detected on the tires.
Panic Button: Simulates an emergency panic button protocol.
Intelligent Speed Adaptation: Adjusts vehicle speed based on weather conditions.
Geofencing Speed Control: Adjusts speed if the vehicle enters a restricted zone (e.g., school zone).
Driver Fatigue Monitoring: Warns the driver if they have been driving for an extended period.
Tire Condition Monitoring: Monitors tire tread depth and alignment.
Lane Departure Warning: Warns if the vehicle is drifting out of its lane.
Traffic Signal Awareness: Alerts the driver when the traffic light is red, yellow, or green.
Collision Detection: Simulates collision risk detection.
Adaptive Cruise Control: Adjusts the cruise control based on road conditions.
Blind Spot Detection: Warns the driver of vehicles in their blind spot.
Weather Condition Detection: Detects current weather conditions.
Auto Parking Assist: Simulates automatic parking assist when a parking space is detected.
How It Works:
The driver can activate or deactivate SDSS manually.
The system provides real-time alerts based on conditions (e.g., weather, driver distraction, lane departure).
Each feature runs based on inputs, and the system responds immediately with relevant actions.
